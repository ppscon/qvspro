# QVS-Pro Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the QVS-Pro application, including measures already implemented and recommendations for ongoing security maintenance.

## Current Security Measures

### Credentials and Secrets Management

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive credentials are stored as environment variables, not in the codebase

### API Security

1. **CORS Configuration**: The API only accepts requests from specified origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (development)
   - `https://qvspro.app` (production)
2. **No Sensitive Data in Responses**: API responses are designed to not expose sensitive information

### Authentication

1. **Supabase Authentication**: User authentication is handled by Supabase, which implements secure authentication practices
2. **JWT-based Sessions**: User sessions are managed using JWT tokens with appropriate expiration

## Security Best Practices

### Credentials Management

1. **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys and secrets regularly (at least every 90 days)
2. **Separate Development and Production Keys**: Use different keys for development and production environments
3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Ensure API keys and service accounts have only the permissions they need

### Code Security

1. **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
   ```bash
   # For frontend
   cd frontend
   npm audit
   npm update

   # For backend
   cd api
   pip list --outdated
   pip install --upgrade <package>
   ```

2. **Code Reviews**: All code changes should be reviewed for security issues before deployment
3. **Static Analysis**: Consider implementing static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues

### Deployment Security

1. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all communication uses HTTPS
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement a Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks
3. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers such as:
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

### Data Security

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary data
2. **Data Encryption**: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
3. **Regular Backups**: Implement regular database backups with secure storage

## Security Incident Response

### Preparation

1. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a plan for responding to security incidents
2. **Contact List**: Maintain a list of contacts for security incident response
3. **Access Control Documentation**: Document who has access to what systems

### Detection

1. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for security-relevant events
2. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for unusual activity
3. **Alerts**: Configure alerts for potential security incidents

### Response

1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
2. **Investigation**: Determine the cause and extent of the incident
3. **Remediation**: Fix the vulnerability and restore systems to normal operation
4. **Communication**: Notify affected parties as required by law or contracts

### Post-Incident

1. **Analysis**: Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify lessons learned
2. **Improvements**: Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents
3. **Documentation**: Document the incident and response for future reference

## Security Testing

1. **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct regular security assessments of the application
2. **Penetration Testing**: Consider periodic penetration testing by security professionals
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Implement regular vulnerability scanning of the application and infrastructure

## Compliance

1. **Data Protection Regulations**: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
2. **Industry Standards**: Follow industry security standards and best practices
3. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of security measures and compliance efforts
