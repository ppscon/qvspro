## Core Architecture Improvements

### Current State
The QVS-Pro currently uses a three-tier architecture with a Go scanner, Python Flask API, and React frontend. While functional, this architecture may face scalability challenges as the system grows.

### Proposed Changes
1. **Microservices Refactoring**
   - Rationale: Breaking the monolithic components into microservices will improve scalability, maintainability, and allow for independent scaling of different system components.
   - Action Items:
     - Decompose the Go scanner into specialized scanning microservices (source code, binary, network, etc.)
     - Implement service discovery and orchestration using Kubernetes
     - Develop a message queue system for asynchronous processing of scan requests

2. **Containerization Strategy**
   - Rationale: Containerization will ensure consistent deployment across environments and facilitate horizontal scaling.
   - Action Items:
     - Create Docker containers for all components
     - Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration
     - Develop Helm charts for simplified deployment

3. **Data Storage Optimization**
   - Rationale: As scan data grows, efficient storage and retrieval become critical.
   - Action Items:
     - Implement a tiered storage strategy (hot/warm/cold)
     - Optimize database schema for scan results
     - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Scanner Engine Enhancements

     - Develop analyzers for common protocols (SSH, IPsec, VPN)
     - Create parsers for configuration files (web servers, OpenSSL, etc.)

4. **Cloud Environment Integration**
   - Rationale: Many organizations use cloud-based cryptographic services that need assessment.
   - Action Items:
     - Develop integrations with AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS
     - Implement scanning for cloud HSM configurations
     - Create cloud-specific remediation recommendations

## API Layer Optimization

3. **API Documentation and Standards**
   - Rationale: Good documentation facilitates integration and adoption.
   - Action Items:
     - Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
     - Standardize API responses and error handling
     - Create developer guides for API integration

## Frontend User Experience

### Current State
The React frontend provides a user interface but may need enhancements for usability and additional features.

### Proposed Changes
1. **Dashboard Enhancement**
   - Rationale: The dashboard is the primary interface for users and should provide clear, actionable insights.
   - Action Items:
     - Develop executive summary views
     - Create technical drill-down capabilities
